= ActivityContextInterface Extension

This simple extension to JAIN SLEE 1.1 introduces [path]_org.mobicents.slee.ActivityContextInterfaceExt_ interface, which extends [path]_javax.slee.ActivityContextInterface_ with methods to retrieve the timers and names bound to the ACI.

[source,java]
----

		
package org.mobicents.slee;

import javax.slee.ActivityContextInterface;
import javax.slee.facilities.TimerID;

public interface ActivityContextInterfaceExt extends ActivityContextInterface {

	public TimerID[] getTimers();

	public String[] getNamesBound();

}
----

The `getTimers()` method:::
  Retrieves the IDs of timers currently set which are related to the ACI.

The `getNamesBound()` method:::
  Retrieves the names currently bound to the ACI.

The `suspend()` method:::
  This feature may be used before attaching to an ActivityContextInterface, to ensure that any event fired concurrently will be received.
  It suspends routing of events in the activity context immediately, till the active transaction ends.
