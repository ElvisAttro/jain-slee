= JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles JPA Mapping

As mentioned in the containers configuration section, &THIS.PLATFORM;JAIN SLEE uses JPA to store all JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles, and in mentioned section it was explained how to define which JPA / Hibernate data source.
In this section more details are provided about how JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles are mapped to a JPA datasource schema.

[[_profile_jpa_tables_and_columns]]
== Profile Specification JPA Tables And columns

For each Profile Specification, at least one  Table is created, and is named `SLEE_PE_` concatenated with the Profile CMP interface simple name (`obtained as java.lang.Class.getSimpleName()`), then `_`, and finally the absolute value of the `hashCode()` method of the javax.slee.ComponentID of the Profile Specification. 

This table has a primary key composed by the profile name and profile table name, and a column for each attribute of the Profile Specification CMP, except for those of array type.
Those columns are named `C`, concatenated with the cmp attribute name. 

For each Profile CMP attribute of [parameter]`array` type, a join table is created, and is named `SLEE_PEAAV_` concatenated with the Profile CMP interface simple name (`obtained as java.lang.Class.getSimpleName()`), then `_`, then the absolute value of `hashCode()` method of the javax.slee.ComponentID of the Profile Specification, and finally the CMP attribute name.
This table has a generated primary key column named `ID`, the foreign key, and two columns to store the CMP attribute value: 

`SERIALIZABLE`::
  Used to store the value if its type does not allow it to be converted to a String. 

`STRING`::
  Used when the CMP attribute type can be converted to a `java.lang.String`, for instance an `Integer`.

== Profile Specification JPA Datasource

Unless configured manually, &THIS.PLATFORM;JAIN SLEE uses the default datasource of &JEE.PLATFORM;.
