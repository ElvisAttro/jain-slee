= JAIN SLEE 1.1 Extensions

&THIS.PLATFORM; exposes proprietary extensions to the  1.1 specification, to allow the development of easier or more powerful application code.

The extensions were discussed among multiple  vendors, and should become part of the standard in next revision, but there is no guarantee that portability won't be lost when using those.

The extensions source code is available in the &PLATFORM_NAME;SLEE Community Git repository, specifically at api/extensions subdirectory.
Its javadocs are bundled in the SLEE binary release, in docs/container/javadoc subdirectory.
The setup for the source project in Eclipse IDE is similar to the container core, as seen in  <<_eclipse_ide>>.

Java archives (JARs) with compiled classes, javadocs and sources are available in the Sonatype Maven Repository at https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/mobicents/servers/jainslee/api/jain-slee-11-ext/
