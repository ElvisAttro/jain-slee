[[_management_jmx_agent]]
== JAIN SLEE JMX Agent

The JMX Agent exposes all MBeans running in the server, including the ones mandated by the JAIN SLEE 1.1 specification.

IMPORTANT: The operations done through the JMX Agent are not kept once the server is shutdown.
For instance, if a deployable unit is installed through JMX, and the server is shutdown, once the server is started again the deployable unit will not be installed.

IMPORTANT: By default, the JMX Agent listens to port 1099, and is only available at the host/ip which the server is bound.

== Management Consoles

[[_management_jmx_console]]
=== JMX Console

{jee-platform} provides a simple web console that gives quick access to all MBeans registered in the server, which includes the ones defined by the JAIN SLEE 1.1 specification.

To access the JMX console once the server is running, point a web browser to `http://ip:8080/jmx-console`, where `ip` is the IP/Host the container is bound.
Unless set during start up, the IP/Host will be `127.0.0.1/localhost` by default.

MBeans in the domain `javax.slee` are all standard JAIN SLEE 1.1 MBeans, while the ones in the domain `org.mobicents.slee` are proprietary to {this-platform}  JAIN SLEE.
The following ones are of particular interest: 

`org.mobicents.slee:service=MobicentsManagement`::
  the MBean which can be used to make non persistent changes to the server configuration, in runtime.
  The operation `dumpContainerState` displays a textual snapshot of the server's state, which can be used to quickly look for memory leaks or other debug/profiling related tasks.

`org.mobicents.slee:name=DeployerMBean`::
  the MBean allows interaction with the persistent deployable unit deployer.
  The operation `showStatus` displays a textual snapshot of the deployers's state, which can be used to quickly find out if there is any deployable unit deployment pending, for instance, due to missing dependencies.

`org.mobicents.slee:name=CongestionControlConfiguration`::
  the MBean allows changing or retrieving the Congestion Control feature, with the container running.
  Details are provided in section <<_congestion_control_configuration>>.

IMPORTANT: For further information about JAIN SLEE 1.1 MBeans and their operations refer to the JAIN SLEE 1.1 Specification, all are covered with great detail.

[[_management_web_console]]
=== SLEE Management Console

The JMX Console is simple but the MBeans operations were made considering its invocation by management clients, not people using browsers.
The SLEE Management Console is a web application that provides high level management functionality for the SLEE, and comes pre-deployed in SLEE binary releases.
To access this console point a web browser to `http://ip:8080/slee-management-console`, where `ip` is the IP/Host the container is bound.
Unless set during start up, the IP/Host will be `127.0.0.1/localhost` by default.

Full documentation for this management tool can be found in [path]_docs/tools/slee-management-console_ directory.

[[_management_jon_console]]
=== {management-platform} Console

{management-platform}was developed to become Red Hat's Middleware Administration Tool, providing an unified interface and extensible model, to be used mainly to control and monitor servers individually, or clusters.

{this-platform} JAIN SLEE binary release includes a {management-platform}Console in [path]_tools/jopr-plugin_, with standalone documentation on same path, but inside [path]_docs_ directory.

[[_management_twiddle_cli]]
=== TWIDDLE CLI

Both,  Console and  {management-platform} Console, are graphic(web) based tools.
Some deployments may require command line access to {this-platform}  .
To aid such cases, {this-platform}  offers `TWIDDLE` based CLI.
It allows to manage single instance (remote or local) of {this-platform}   server. 

{this-platform} JAIN SLEE binary release includes a TWIDDLE CLI in [path]_tools/twiddle_, with standalone documentation on same path, but inside [path]_docs_ directory.
