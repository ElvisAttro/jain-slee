= Preferred Packages Extension

This extension to JAIN SLEE 1.1 introduces the ability to override server provided classes from SBB/Lib components.

The SBB developer may define the list of packages to be overriden, by using an special environment entry in SBB descriptor.
If SBB declares SLEE library dependencies, the list of preferred packages will be applied to the library as well.

<env-entry>
	<env-entry-name>org.restcomm.slee.preferred-package-list</env-entry-name>
	<env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
	<env-entry-value>org.hibernate,dom4j,javax.transaction,org.jboss.logging,javax.persistence,net.sf.ehcache</env-entry-value>
</env-entry>
----

The "org.restcomm.slee.preferred-package-list" entry  contains  a comma
separated list of base packages that will be used during class loading.
Any class under those packages, will have the classloading order inverted, so
local class definition to SBB will be taken before server classes.
