	<title>Congestion Control</title>
	
	<para>JAIN SLEE can monitor the memory available in the JVM. In case it drops to a certain level (percentage), new events and/or activity startups are rejected, and at the same time a JAIN SLEE Alarm (which can send JMX notifications) is raised. This feature is called Congestion Control, and the container will turn it off automatically once another available memory level is reached.</para>
	
	<para>If Congestion Control rejects an operation, a <classname>javax.slee.SleeException</classname> is thrown. This means that if the feature is to be used, the Resource Adaptors and Applications need to handle such use case, and behave properly.</para>
	
	<para>The type of JAIN SLEE Alarm raised is <application>org.mobicents.slee.management.alarm.congestion</application>.</para>
	
	<para>Congestion Control is turned off by default.</para>
	
	<section id="congestion_control_configuration">
		<title>Congestion Control Configuration</title>
	
		<para>The Congestion Control feature is configured through an XML file or through a JMX MBean. Changes applied through JMX are not persisted, and once the container is restarted the configuration will revert to the one in the XML file.</para>
