The Telestax team is glad to announce that RestComm SLEE 
2.8.0.FINAL is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The SLEE Core includes an updated container with extended event 
router stats and a fix with respect to child sbb entity persistent 
state issue. The Web Management Console also includes a fix for an 
issue displaying Activities TTL. The Core includes a new tool, an 
revamped SNMP Adaptor, which allows monitoring of the SLEE using 
the popular management protocol.

Regarding the Diameter package, all Resource Adaptors were updated 
to include a few fixes.

With respect to HTTP package, the team is glad to introduce the new 
HTTP Client NIO Resource Adaptor, which should allow much better 
perfomance in applications doing many concurrent HTTP requests.

The Media package was also updated, it include an MGCP Resource 
Adaptor using a new, more performant, MGCP stack.

This release SIP package updates the SIP11 Resource Adaptor, to 
include fixes for a couple of issues.

Finnally, the new SS7 package introduces CAP and TCAP Resource 
Adaptors. The latest RestComm SS7 3.0.1336 stack is also bundled.
 
About RestComm JAIN SLEE:
 
RestComm JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant production ready platform, a low latency and 
high throughput application/service environment for event processing, 
designed for stringent requirements of core network signaling application, 
and to support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic.

RestComm JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included, such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Telscale platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
